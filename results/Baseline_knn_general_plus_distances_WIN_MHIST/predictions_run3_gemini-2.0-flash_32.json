examples and their classifications:\n\n*   **hp (distance 0.0644):** this image displays fairly straight crypts and seems to have abundant goblet cells.\n*   **ssa (distance 0.0662):** this image shows some crypt distortion. the goblet cells are fewer, and serrations are seen.\n*   **hp (distance 0.0669):** this example presents regular crypts and cells.\n*   **ssa (distance 0.0669):** in this example, crypts display distortion and branching. goblet cell population appears decreased.\n\ngiven that the query image is closer to the 'hp' images and displays relatively straight crypts with some goblet cells, but also has some features that are similar to the 'ssa' images such as crypt dilation, branching and serrations, it's a difficult call.\nhowever, weighting by the closer distances, the classification is likely hp.\n\n**final classification:**\n\nclassification: hp"}, {"run_id": 3, "model": "gemini-2.0-flash", "n_shots": 32, "sample_idx": 967, "y_true": 1, "y_pred": 1,
